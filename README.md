Voice Changer
=============
This is a simple program, which allows for manipulating voice recordings. The main goal of this project is to find ways of manipulating voice recordings using only basic audio effects in such a way that the manipulated voice sounds as realistic as possible, but the speaker cannot be identified by listeners.

Additional information
----------------------
1. This version of Voice Changer allows only for processing WAV and MP3 files and offers text interface (different options can be chosen by typing their indices). 

2. There are 3 ways of sourcing files for processing:
- providing path of an existing file
- recording a new file using built-in recorder
- creating a new file using Text To Speech synthesizer by TECHMO sp. z o. o.

3. Pedalboard tests.py is an addiotional script used for assessment of a few presets and is not a part of the program.
