Voice Changer
=============
This is a simple program, which allows for manipulating voice recordings. The main goal of this project is to find ways of manipulating voice recordings using only basic audio effects in such a way that the manipulated voice sounds as realistic as possible, but the speaker cannot be identified by listeners.

This version of Voice Changer allows only for processing WAV and MP3 files and offers text interface (different options can be chosen by typing their indices). 

There are 3 ways of sourcing files for processing:
- providing path of an existing file
- recording a new file using built-in recorder
- creating a new file using Text To Speech synthesizer by TECHMO sp. z o. o.
